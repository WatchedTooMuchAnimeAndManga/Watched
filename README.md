Virtual piano bot 

virtual piano bot with Tempo Control
This Python script simulates keyboard input based on a custom "song" text file, allowing you to automate typing or play rhythm-based patterns with configurable tempo, chords, and error simulation.

Features:

Play single notes and chords (simultaneous keys)

Pause (p), resume, and stop (esc) controls during playback

Adjustable tempo via BPM (beats per minute)

Real-time tempo control (+ / - keys) during playback

Simulated human-like typing errors with nearby key mistakes

Simple song format with pauses and chords support

Manual Song File Selection
Instead of hardcoding the song file path, this script allows you to select your song text file interactively each time it runs:

When you start the script, a file dialog window will pop up.

You can browse your folders and pick any .txt file containing your song notes.

This makes it easier to manage multiple song files without changing the code.
